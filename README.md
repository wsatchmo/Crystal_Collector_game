###A simple but fun math game. 

Change the images in the *images* folder to create a new theme. You'll also likely want to change the fonts (in the *fonts* folder), as well as the audio, which is currently **Clink.wav** in the master folder. This corresponds to the link in the *audio* tag on the html.

Feel free to add more crystals -- simply copy the JavaScript from the comment **bluecrystal begin** to the comment **bluecrystal end** and change the parameters to configure new numbers. Take a look into the **multicrystal**, **blackcrystal**, and **whitecrystal** functions if you are trying to make a more creative and dynamic outcome.

And if you do create a new theme, don't forget to **change the story within the `<p>` tags**!
